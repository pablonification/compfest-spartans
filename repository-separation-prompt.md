# Repository Separation Strategy

## Overview
I need to separate my current Next.js and Python FastAPI monorepo into two distinct repositories for independent deployment, better error isolation, and improved debugging capabilities. The current project structure has a frontend Next.js application in the `app/` directory and a Python backend in the `backend/` directory, along with shared configurations and documentation.

## Objectives
Please help me create a plan to:

### 1. Extract the Frontend Repository
- **Core Application**: All Next.js application code from `app/` directory
- **Configurations**: Frontend-specific configs (`package.json`, `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `jsconfig.json`)
- **Docker Setup**: Frontend Docker configuration (`Dockerfile.frontend`)
- **Assets**: Public assets and static files from `public/`
- **Documentation**: Frontend-specific documentation

### 2. Extract the Backend Repository
- **Core Application**: All Python backend code from `backend/` directory
- **Dependencies**: Backend configurations (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`)
- **Docker Setup**: Backend Docker configuration (`backend/Dockerfile`)
- **Database**: Database schemas and migrations (`prisma/`)
- **Testing**: Backend-specific tests and documentation

### 3. Handle Shared Concerns
- **Environment Management**: Create separate environment configuration templates
- **API Contracts**: Document API contracts and interfaces between frontend and backend
- **CI/CD**: Set up independent CI/CD pipelines for each repository
- **Communication**: Establish clear communication protocols (REST APIs, WebSocket connections)
- **Deployment**: Create deployment configurations that allow independent scaling and debugging

### 4. Deployment Infrastructure
Enable:
- Independent deployment schedules for frontend and backend
- Isolated error monitoring and logging for each service
- Separate environment variables and secrets management
- Independent rollback capabilities without affecting the other service
- Better resource allocation and scaling for each component

## Requirements
Please provide a detailed step-by-step guide for this separation, including:
- File organization and structure
- Docker configurations for independent deployment
- Environment setup and configuration
- Deployment strategies that enable better error handling
- Debugging capabilities for each service independently

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved error isolation and debugging
- Independent service scaling and deployment
- Better resource management
- Enhanced development workflow
- Clearer service boundaries and responsibilities
