# Project Logbook

## Session 1: Fixing Deployment Issues

### User Request

The user wants to fix "all the WPS deployment shit" and wants a logbook of all actions taken.

### Initial Analysis

1.  **Clarification needed:** The term "WPS" is unclear. I have asked the user for clarification on what it means and what specific deployment issues they are facing.
2.  **`docker-compose.yml` review:**
    *   The project uses Docker and is orchestrated with `docker-compose`.
    *   Services include `backend`, `frontend`, `rag-test-frontend`, `mongodb`, `redis`, and `iot_simulator`.
    *   **Potential issues identified:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** The configuration relies heavily on environment variables (e.g., `${MONGODB_URI}`). A missing or misconfigured `.env` file is a likely source of problems.
        *   **Frontend API URLs:** The use of both `NEXT_PUBLIC_BROWSER_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTAINER_API_URL` can be a point of failure if not configured correctly for different environments (development vs. production).
        *   **Networking:** Services are on a default Docker network. While functional, a custom network would be more robust for service discovery and isolation.
        *   **Test services:** `rag-test-frontend` seems like a service that might not be intended for a production deployment.
3.  **Logbook:** No logbook file was found. I am creating this `logbook.md` to track all work done, as requested.

### Next Steps

- Awaiting user clarification on "WPS" and specific deployment problems.
- Once I have more information, I will formulate a plan to address the issues.

## Session 2: VPS Deployment Hardening

### User Request

User asked to "fix the VPS deployment".

### Actions Taken

1.  **Improved Networking:**
    *   Modified `docker-compose.yml` to define a custom bridge network named `smartbin-network`.
    *   Assigned all services (`backend`, `frontend`, `mongodb`, etc.) to this network.
    *   **Reasoning:** This improves service discovery and isolation, making inter-service communication more reliable and secure than relying on the default Docker network.

2.  **Secured MongoDB:**
    *   Updated the `mongodb` service definition in `docker-compose.yml` to include `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variables.
    *   **Reasoning:** Running a database on a publicly accessible VPS without authentication is a critical security vulnerability. This change enforces password protection.

3.  **Created Environment Variable Guide:**
    *   Attempted to create a `.env.example` file to guide the user in setting up their environment. The creation was blocked by a file protection rule.
    *   Provided the contents of the `.env.example` file to the user directly in the chat.
    *   **Reasoning:** The `docker-compose.yml` file relies on many environment variables. This file documents them, provides sensible defaults for local development, and explains how to configure them for a VPS deployment, reducing the chance of misconfiguration.

### Next Steps

- Waiting for the user to create the `.env.example` file and populate the `.env` file on their VPS.
- Awaiting feedback on whether these changes have resolved their deployment issues, or if there are other specific errors to address.
